# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI assistant project currently in initial setup phase. The project contains a Product Requirements Document (PRD.md) which should be consulted for feature requirements and specifications.

## Project Structure

The repository is currently being initialized. Key files:
- `PRD.md` - Product Requirements Document outlining the assistant's features and requirements

## Development Setup

As this is a new project, the following initial setup tasks may be needed:
1. Initialize the project with appropriate package manager (npm, yarn, pip, etc.) based on chosen technology stack
2. Set up project structure according to the requirements in PRD.md
3. Configure development environment and tooling

## Architecture Decisions

When implementing this AI assistant, consider:
- The technology stack should be chosen based on the requirements specified in PRD.md
- Follow established patterns for the chosen framework/language
- Ensure proper separation of concerns between components
- Implement appropriate error handling and logging from the start

## Important Considerations

- Always refer to PRD.md for feature requirements before implementing new functionality
- As this is a greenfield project, establish consistent coding patterns early
- Document major architectural decisions as the project evolves
- Set up appropriate testing infrastructure as components are added
